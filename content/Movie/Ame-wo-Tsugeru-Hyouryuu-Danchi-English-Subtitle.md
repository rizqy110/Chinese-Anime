One day during the summer vacation, they visit a housing complex that is scheduled to be demolished. Having grown up there, the place holds a lot of memories, but while playing, they suddenly get caught up in a mysterious phenomenon. When they regain consciousness, they see an entire ocean before them as the housing complex has drifted into a mysterious sea with Kousuke, Natsume, and others in it. Will they be able to return to their previous world? A summer farewell journey begins...
